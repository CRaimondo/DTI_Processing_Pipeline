This folder contains scripts in MATLAB for mean apparent propagator (MAP) processing of DTI outputs, as seen in this paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117616

MiSFITtest.m is the script as presented in the paper, and bulkMAP is a version of the script designed to execute the MAP processing on multiple patient folders at once.
